Future v3.2:
- Gif Animation
- Cummulative Conflict
- Speed up GuessDistPathGrid
- Guess Path Algorithms and compare time savings
    - Try Dijkstra
- Guess Path Class

- Record and Replay (could be major change)
- Seperate out:
    - Simulation
    - Figure Gen
    - Replay (pending)
- Conflict retention (major change)

Target Assignment Problem v3.2:
- Test Guess Path
- Guess Path Algorithms and compare time savings
- Code Restructuring
- Heat Map Include in Simulation
- Integration of Guess in the code which tracking trajectories
- Update Agent Class
    - accept path
    - trajectories
- Energy - update Pair Matching and Agent Class
- Update figure to include Heat Map
- Merge Domain into Environment Variable argument
- Debugging of error if the conflict point lies inside no-fly zone

Target Assignment Problem v3.1:
- with return constraints
- also includes battery restoration upon return
- Agent and Conflict Point Class
- Replaced the notion of Distance with Energy. The calculation still uses distance.
- Update conflict points in Figure to Scatter Points
- Choice of Conflict points from Toy problem or Taos Wildfire Simulation
